## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alon, a software developer who gets excited about understanding how things work at a fundamental level. Whether I'm building web applications, reverse engineering binaries, or hunting for security vulnerabilities, I'm always curious about what's happening under the hood. I love exploring new technologies and there's always something new to learn in this field - honestly, I'm probably too all over the place. I'll get fascinated by something today, spend a week diving deep into it, and then suddenly get distracted by something completely different that catches my attention.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me jamming on guitar and piano.

## What I'm Good At

**Full-stack web development** - I build applications that actually work and scale properly, from the database all the way to the user interface.

**Reverse engineering** - Give me a binary and some time with IDA or Ghidra, and I'll tell you exactly what it's doing under the hood.

**Low-level programming** - Assembly and systems languages like C, C++, and Rust are where I feel most at home. There's something satisfying about working close to the hardware.

**Network security** - I understand protocols and know how to find their weak points. I've done my share of ARP spoofing, DNS manipulation, WEP cracking, and web shell exploitation.

**Software architecture** - I follow solid design patterns (MVC, DDD, SOLID principles) because maintainable code is happy code.

## Some Fun Stories

**Back in 5th grade,** I discovered a major security flaw in my school's website. Turns out it was built on a popular forum platform, so the exploit actually affected way more than just our school. I reported it to the staff, and the developers fixed it pretty quickly.

**In 8th grade,** I managed to phish every student's phone number at my school (don't worry, it was for educational purposes!). Let's just say everyone learned a valuable lesson about phishing that day.

## When I'm Not Coding

- Playing guitar and piano
- Building random projects that seem like good ideas at 2 AM
- Reverse engineering software to understand how it works
- Bug hunting and responsible disclosure
- Playing around with my SDR (software-defined radio) - receiving live images from NOAA weather satellites and mapping ADS-B signals from planes
- Learning whatever catches my attention

## My Daily Setup

**Code editors:** [Neovim](https://neovim.io), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) suite - all configured with [Vim](https://www.vim.org) keybindings because life's too short for arrow keys

**Operating systems:** [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11) on my main PC, [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org) on my laptop, and [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org) because, well, I use Arch btw

**Reverse engineering setup:** [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free) + [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org) for the heavy lifting, with [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net) for investigating and analysis
