# About me
Hello! I am Alon. I am currently working on coding [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
As you can see I have only a few public repos because I'm mostly working on private ones only to connect them with [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
I was also a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/) plugin developer earlier this year, but I am currently not focusing on that.

### Experienced coding languages
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) / [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) / [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) / [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Skript](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skript) (Not really a coding language but I'll include this anyways)

### Technical information
- I am coding on [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- I run [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/he-il/software-download/windows10).
- I have 8GB of RAM.

### Some fun information
- I sometimes play [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
- I was used to fly planes on [X-Plane 11](https://www.x-plane.com/) Flight Simulator.
- I have experience with [Skript](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skript).

Thanks for checking me out!
